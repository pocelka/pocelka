Hello,

My name is Peter Ocelka, and in the company where I'm employeed, I've worked mostly on data migration projects with Oracle database.

I'm huge fan of Oracle Application Express (APEX), PL/SQL and automation. Although I don't have any experience with APEX projects, I've created few applications as a proof of concept (PoC). Due to other priorities I did not continue with further development, however as I strongly believe that this is the technology with a great future.

My current focus is on:

- Getting better in automation and IaaC (ansible, terraform, github actions, jenkins).
- Continue learning APEX through some personal projects.

In my repositories, you can find personal projects which I'm working on or, projects which I'm using to PoCs during learning process.

- 💞️ I’m looking for APEX mentor.
- 📫 You can reach me via email peter.ocelka@gmail.com
