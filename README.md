Hello, 

My name is Peter Ocelka, and in the company where I'm employeed, I've worked mostly on data migration projects. Currently I'm acting as "junior" DBA for Oracle database. 

I'm huge fan of Oracle Application Express (APEX) and automation. Although I don't have any experience with APEX projects, I've created few applications as a proof of concept. Due to other priorities I did not continue with further development, however as I strongly believe that this is the technology with a great future I would very much like to learn more about APEX and enhance the applications which I have created in the past. 

In my repositories, you can find personal projects which I'm working on; mostly as a learning activity.

- 💞️ I’m looking for APEX mentor.
- 📫 You can reach me via email peter.ocelka@gmail.com
